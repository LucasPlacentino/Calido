# Calido
### &lt;Calido> - Open Smart Thermostat and Smart Home Controller based on a Nordic Semiconductor Thingy:91

Project can be found on [here (Electromaker.io)](404).

A *Make it smart with Nordic Thingy:91 (Electromaker.io)* contest project.

## Use
Calido was built to monitor and control a house temperature, humidity and overall air quality and its heating system, to control other smart-home devices and to notify the user.

## Set up
Set up your wifi SSID and password in Calido's settings.

To access Calido, go to its webpage via its local ip adress (probably something like `https://192.168.*.***/`, check your router's connected devices to find it), or its local domain adress (if you configured it in your local DNS server like Pi-Hole).

## Details
The LTE connectivity of the Thingy:91 allows Calido to still send data to the user even if the home internet is not working.
